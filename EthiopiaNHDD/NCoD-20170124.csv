FMOH: Not a duplicate; possibly a good example. ICD-10 doesn't specify diseases as Ebola or Zika but are currently pandemic and public health challenges. Though the diseases present with similar symptoms, causative agents are different RNA viruses. Thus, clinical management is different, etc. Hence, the diseases need to be reported separately. We customized them to a category called 'Other specified viral haemorrhagic fevers'. In fact the purpose of this group - ""other ..."" ( as frequently mentioned in ICD-10) was to act as a place holder and account for those diseases that were not specified in ICD-10.

JP: Where relevant, will classify maps to A98.8 as ""Narrower Than""

AK: This is a problem. If there is no specific concept created for Zika or Ebola then it can't/shouldn't be mapped to A98.8 because it is unspecified. If they want to track those, they should be created separately. Zika is mapped to A92.8 and Ebola is mapped to A98.4.

FMOH: This has been a ""grey area"" until recently, but the issue comes up due to reporting challenges. We didn't either know where to put it. Yet, there isn't a correct code for confirmed Zika virus infection. Perhaps, the A92.8 (Other specified mosquito-borne viral fevers) suggestion looks appropraite.

FMOH: not a duplicate

DT: Perform clinical review - suggest new, custom ICD-10 code for just ""Dacryocystitis"" as a more specific code for P39.1 ""Neonatal conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis""

ASK: Apparently a header term is being used again. Dacryocystitis is a separate condition and is mapped to ICD . It not specified as neonatal, however. A better term would be Neonatal Dacryocystitis which is CIEL 133412.
