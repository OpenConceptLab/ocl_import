An increase in this indicator suggests that a higher proportion of HIV patients are being screened for TB and other increased efforts such as: developing a standard screening algorithm, training HIV staff, revising cards/registers, etc. A decrease in this indicator suggests that a lower proportion of PLWH are being screened for TB and change in policy or program.

In resource limited settings, 30 to 49 year old women comprise the target groups because cervical cancer is rare in women under 30. Screening younger women will detect many lesions that are not likely to develop into cancer, which will lead to considerable overtreatment, which is not cost-effective. New Programs should start by screening women aged 30 years or more. Thus, this indicator is intended to monitor trends in provision of counseling and screening services for cervical cancer. Data should be generated by counting the total number of individuals who received screening service at service delivery points (family planning clinics) from health facilities providing the service.  There is sufficient evidence that cervical cancer screening can reduce cervical cancer mortality by 80%or more among screened women. Recent developments in technologies adapted to low-resource settings make screening and treatment of cervical pre-cancer lesions feasible and highly cost-effective for all countries. Early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can result in massive improvements of survival, and are especially important in developing countries where access to expensive cancer treatment is limited. ","By outcome:
