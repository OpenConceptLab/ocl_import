"<h2>Ethiopia National Classification of Diseases</h2><p>The revision of the national disease reporting system was undertaken to ensure that disease classifications conform to national and international standards (“standardization”), uses a single reporting channel (“integration”), and is limited to an essential list of diseases attuned to the diagnostic capacity at each level of the health system (“simplification”). A set of principles were adopted to ensure a consistent approach across all disease classifications: (i) organization of disease categories according to the ICD-10 framework with specification of ICD-codes corresponding to each diagnosis (or disease categories); (ii) harmonization of the disease list with the international standards: Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) protocols (using disease names in IDSR list), ICD-10 codes and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) classification; and (iii) focus on reporting to the national level only for those diseases that are relevant for epidemiological surveillance, planning and management purposes at that level (FMOH, 2008). The revision of the National Classification of Diseases was completed in 2016 and initial testing is expected to be completed in 2017 before scaling up nationally.</p><p>The revised National Classification of Disease (NCoD) consists of 2,054 disease classifications, published as three editions based on the level of care:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/collections/NCoD-Mini/\">The Mini Edition</a> - intended for use at health centers</li><li><a href=\"/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/collections/NCoD-Compact/\">The Compact Edition</a> - intended for use at primary and general hospitals</li><li><a href=\"/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/collections/NCoD-Extended/\">The Extended Edition</a> - intended for use at specialized hospitals and for reference purposes</li></ul>"
