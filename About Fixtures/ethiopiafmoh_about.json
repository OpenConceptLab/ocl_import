"<h2>Ethiopia National Health Data Dictionary Overview</h2>\n<p>The Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MOH) has invested substantial resources in developing data recording and reporting guidelines throughout the health system. The National Health Data Dictionary (NHDD) captures the definitions of data elements, indicators, and the relationships between these elements to improve the MOH’s ability to manage data recording and reporting guidelines and to harmonize data across many stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Given the large quantity of health system materials that could be included in the NHDD, data dictionary content will be developed in multiple phases. The scope for the initial 2016 release of the NHDD was selected through conversations with the Policy and Planning Directorate (PPD) and Health Information Technology Directorate (HITD) and approved by the National Advisory Committee (NAC). The initial scope was designed to enable progress on near-term goals while building capacity and informing planning for future work. PPD confirmed that a natural starting point would be the Health Management Information System (HMIS), through which standardized health cards and registers are summarized in tallies and aggregated using periodic disease and service reports. The National Classification of Diseases (NCoD), Family Folder and Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) system represent data and reports within the same framework and were also included in the initial NHDD release.</p>\n<p>The scope for the initial release of the NHDD was designed to support achievement of the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Serve as the starting point to comprehensively map the data inputs, outputs, and flows of the national HMIS, Ethiopia’s primary framework for monitoring and evaluating its health system</li>\n<li>Result in digital publication of a subset of the Ethiopian MOH’s key terminology assets, improving accessibility of shared definitions to all stakeholders</li>\n<li>Provide the basis for revisions to HMIS and CHIS data recording and reporting guidelines. For example, a harmonized data dictionary will ensure that registers are feeding into HMIS indicators in a uniform manner</li>\n<li>Improve consistency and comparability of data collected across HMIS/CHIS registers, in part through mappings to international reference vocabularies</li>\n<li>Support electronic and paper-based distribution of revised NCoD codes</li>\n<li>Guide planning for establishing terminology governance, integrating data across multiple paper and electronic information systems (e.g. data warehouse and visualization platforms), and expanding the scope of the data dictionary in the future</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>NHDD v1.0 Scope</h2>\n<p>The following indicators and data definitions were modeled and incorporated into NHDD v1.0:</p>\n<ul><li>HMIS indicators - 122 indicators</li>\n<li>HSTP indicators - 176 indicators</li>\n<li>National Classification of Diseases (NCoD) grouped into extended, compact, and mini editions (2,054 codes across all editions)</li>\n<li>Clinical concepts from selected HMIS registers, including:\n<ul><li>Comprehensive Abortion Care Register</li><li>Antenatal Care Register</li><li>Labor and Delivery Register</li><li>Growth Monitoring Register</li><li>Infant Immunization and Growth Monitoring Register</li><li>Family Planning Register</li><li>Inpatient Admission / Discharge (IPD) Register</li><li>Outpatient (OPD) Register</li><li>Operation Register</li><li>Post-Exposure to HIV Prophylaxis (PEP) Follow Up Register</li><li>PMTCT Register</li><li>Postnatal Care (PNC) Register</li><li>Referral Register</li><li>Tetanus Toxoid Immunization Register</li><li>Voluntary Counseling and Testing Register</li></ul></li>\n<li>Clinical concepts from the Family Folder based on the October 2010 CHIS User Manual for Data Recording and Reporting, including:\n<ul><li>Family Folder Pouch</li><li>Blue Health Card</li><li>Yellow Health Card</li><li>Integrated Maternal and Child Care Card</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>NHDD v1.1 is planned for release during the first quarter of 2017 and will include the remaining HMIS registers. Specifically, the following registers will be modeled and incorporated into the NHDD:</p>\n<ul><li>ART Register</li><li>Leprosy Register</li><li>MDR-TB Register</li><li>MDR-TB Follow up Register</li><li>Pre-ART register, Pre ART Register</li><li>Leprosy Register for Care after Completion of Treatment (RFT) Register</li><li>Unit TB Register</li><li>IMNCI Register</li></ul>"
